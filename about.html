    ❤️❤️❤️<br>
    This is ABOUT you , about me and all about us. <br>How we started and where we are now.<br> 
    Started off as two stupid kids preparing for a competative exam and look where we ended up.
    <br> Its been a year to our relationship and a little more than a year of knowing you and yet you seem like the closest a person has ever been to me.<br>
    You were my friend, my best friend and now you are my girlfriend and i pray you become my wife.<br>
    Life has been fun lately amidst all the stressful time.<br> And all the credit goes to you.
    <br>And you were also there when life was not fun and not worth living , when staying alive made no sense.<br>
     You helped me get out of that phase and took care of me.<br> I will forever be grateful to you.<br> Your butterfly earrings deserve more appreciation fr lol 
     <br> wont talk much about allen days , dont want to give you ptsd.<br> But what a time that was, bunking classes to go to city centre and central mall, watching movies , eating food , and all that sexual tension in the air. DAMN!
     <br> Heritage date, you bringing food for me in class, coffee dates, planning and plotting and those late night gossips.<br>
     Talking about things that made no sense , and yet you would participate actively.<br> never have I ever talked to a person so much.
     <br> It was then that I realised that either something was wrong with me or you were just very special. Well it turned out to be both.
     <br> I did a self checkup , realised I was diagnosed with LOVE, like damn gurl what did you do to me?
     <br> Every time I think about it, I am fascinated and amazed at how easily it was to fall in love with you.
     <br> You seemed like you were not just another person , you were a part of me.
     <br> The rough JEE phase was over and finally we got to study together in a university.
     <br> And everything was worth this life.
     <br> I have no regrets , even if I were sent to the past I would not change I would take the same path that lead me to you.
     <br> I might not be the brightest mind, or the most athletic or have the sexiest build or a pretty face, but what I do have is my heart that beats for YOU and ONLY YOU!
     <BR> I love you anika , I love you so very much. And I wish to love you for the rest of my life.
     <br> I agree I have made a ton of mistakes and made you cry a lot of times and hurt you in numerous occasions , but I swear I have never ever thought of any evil.
     <br> Forgive me for all those times and trust me I will never let you down.
     <br> Cheers to us.
     <br> Cheers to one whole year of MUNIKA.
     <br> And pray for more years to come, I hope we both will love each other more and more and stay by each others side till the end of times.  
     <br>❤️❤️❤️
